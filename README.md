# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual representation of a website or application's layout and structure. It focuses on the core elements and functionality, without the distractions of visual design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Think of it as a blueprint for your digital product.

## Importance in the Design Process
Wireframing plays a crucial role in the design process by:
- Clarifying structure and content: It helps in defining the hierarchy of information and the placement of key elements.
- Facilitating early feedback: Stakeholders can review and provide input on the layout and user flow before significant design work begins, saving time and resources.
- Improving usability: By focusing on functionality and user experience, wireframes help identify potential usability issues early on.
- Streamlining development: A clear wireframe provides developers with a solid foundation to build upon, reducing misunderstandings and rework.
# Requirement Analysis

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process. It involves understanding and specifying what services the system should provide and the constraints under which it must operate.

### Key Aspects:
- Elicitation: Gathering requirements from stakeholders
- Analysis: Understanding and refining requirements
- Specification: Documenting requirements clearly
- Validation: Ensuring requirements are correct and complete

### Importance in SDLC:
- Forms the foundation for all subsequent development phases
- Reduces project risks and costs by identifying issues early
- Ensures the final product meets stakeholder needs
- Provides clear guidelines for developers and testers
- Helps in project planning and estimation
