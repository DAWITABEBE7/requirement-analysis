# Requirement Analysis

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process. It involves understanding and specifying what services the system should provide and the constraints under which it must operate.

### Key Aspects:
- Elicitation: Gathering requirements from stakeholders
- Analysis: Understanding and refining requirements
- Specification: Documenting requirements clearly
- Validation: Ensuring requirements are correct and complete

### Importance in SDLC:
- Forms the foundation for all subsequent development phases
- Reduces project risks and costs by identifying issues early
- Ensures the final product meets stakeholder needs
- Provides clear guidelines for developers and testers
- Helps in project planning and estimation
